# Soumapitest
This sript tests API for the given API request using Python with the requests library and unittest framework. This script covers various test cases to validate the functionality and performance of the API.
The TestProductAPI class contains individual test methods to cover different scenarios.
Each test method sends a request to the API with specific parameters and headers and asserts the response status code and content.
Test cases cover scenarios such as valid parameters, missing parameters, invalid headers, invalid page numbers, and negative sizes.
Additional test cases can be added to cover more edge cases or specific scenarios.
Running this script will execute all test cases and provide a summary of the results.
